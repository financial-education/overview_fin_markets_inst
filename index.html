<h2 id="org745f343"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Financial Markets</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Financial markets enable the exchange of securities for money.  At any given point on time there are market participants who have excess money, and those who need money.  Financial markets allow those who need money to sell securities to those with excess money.  That is:
</p>

<p>
Need money: create a security and sell it for cash.
Excess money: buy a security in exchange for cash.
</p>

<p>
You can think of a <i>security</i> as a framework of repayment.  If today I have excess money I buy a security which affords me a structure of repayment convenient to my future financial needs.
</p>

<p>
There are two broad category of securities&#x2014;debt and equity&#x2014;and the motivation for this exchange (the reason to need cash) can vary depending on the security.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Debt Securities</b></b>: These securities are formal contracts where an issuer borrows from the debt buyer. They have a maturity, and generally regular payments prior to maturity.  Repayment is comprised of <i>interest</i> and <i>principal</i> payments. Examples are bonds and mortgages.  Who has excess money, and who needs money in these examples?
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Equity Securities</b></b>: These represent ownership of a business.  This gives the owner control of the business, and this is infinitely lived&#x2014;there is no maturity.  Repayment is a residual claim on the business's income.  If there is no income, the buyer receives nothing.  Stock in a company, for example <code>TSLA</code>, is an equity security.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Derivatives</b></b> are a third type of security which derives its value from prices of the previous two types of securities, as well as on other external events.  Derivatives are not used to transfer money from those who need it to those with excess, but rather derivatives allow market participants to manage taxes and risk (exposure to events).  Derivatives may also be used to speculate.  The existence of derivatives on an asset, however, can materially affect the value of that asset.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
In <i>Investements</i> we discuss the benefits of allowing prices to fluctuate freely in financial markets.  [See these notes for a reminder](<a href="https://financial-education.github.io/why_we_have_free_markets">https://financial-education.github.io/why_we_have_free_markets</a>).  Free markets:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Incorporate information into prices.</li>
<li>This organizes society through price signals.</li>

<h3 id="orgf95f802"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Primary and Secondary Markets</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
A <b><b>primary market</b></b> is one where the security issuer is involved.  For example, the Initial Public Offering (IPO) market is a primary market because the company is selling shares to investors (investors receive equity and the company received cash).  Another example is US Treasury auctions of bonds.  <a href="https://www.treasurydirect.gov/auctions/results/">You can view the results of these auctions here</a>.
</p>

<p>
A <b><b>secondary market</b></b> is one where the issuer of the security is not involved.  For example, if you buy <code>NVDA</code> stock today in the stock market, you are buying it from another person who owns <code>NVDA</code>.  This is a secondary market transaction.  Note I am using <i>stock market</i> as a short-hand for the National Market System (or NMS).  Similarly, if you buy Bitcoin on the Coinbase exchange, this is a secondary market transaction.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Why the distinction?</b></b>  We make a distinction because these markets operate very differently and there are different market participants.  Think of the difficulty of determining an IPO price&#x2014;this takes unique skills and methods.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Do Companies Care what their stock price is on the Secondary Market?</b></b>  Absolutely, for a number of reasons:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Management performance is evaluated buy how the stock has done.</li>
<li>New primary market sales of stock are done near the present stock price in the secondary market.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="org870394d"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Money and Capital Markets</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
<b><b>Money markets</b></b> are markets for securities which behave roughly like money.  Specifically, a money market security is a debt security with a maturity of one year or less. Remembering our intro economics, money is anything that (1) is a medium of exchange, (2) and a store of value.  Short-term debt securities, such as T-bills, meet both criteria. Some examples of money-market securities are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>T-Bills</li>
<li>Commercial Paper</li>
<li>Negotiable Certificates of Deposit</li>
<li>Eurodollar</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b><b>Capital markets</b></b> are those markets where securities issued for <i>capital</i> investments are traded. A <i>capital</i> investment is a long-term investment such as in plant and equipment.  So capital market securities are defined to be equity securities, and debt securities with a maturity greater than 1 year.  Some examples of capital-market securities are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Stock</li>
<li>Corporate Bonds</li>
<li>Treasury Notes/Bonds</li>
<li>Asset-Backed (such as by mortgages) Securities</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b><b>Why the distinction?</b></b>  We make a distinction between these markets because the participants are different, and different factors are taken into account when valuing these securities.  For example, money-market mutual funds specialize in buying money market securities.  However stock/bond mutual funds, hedge funds, pension funds specialize in buying capital market securities.  Moreover when deciding to buy a money market security we only care about the firm's ability to remain solvent over the short-run, so we are interested in measures such as the current or quick ratios.  Alternatively, capital market investors care about a firms growth prospects and solvency over years and decades, and thus consider measures such as ROA, and the debt-to-equity ratio.
